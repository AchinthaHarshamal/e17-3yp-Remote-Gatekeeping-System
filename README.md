## Overview
In the busy and complicated lifestyle today, keeping interactions with outsiders is, inefficient, impractical and vulnerable.
The ongoing pandemic has worsen the situatoin. 

We have understood that people are having troubles with taking online deliveries to their door steps securely.
Since people in Sri Lanka are so busy today, they canâ€™t pay much attention about their loved once and the household.
So, we thought we can come up with a system of interconnected devices (inspired from IoT) to make the life easy for the people.

Our goal is to provide a user-friendly and completely automated solution for the above problems, which will be a success even after the end of the pandemic.
