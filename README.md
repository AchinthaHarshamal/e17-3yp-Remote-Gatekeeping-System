## Overview
In the busy and complicated lifestyle today, keeping interactions with outsiders is, inefficient, impractical and vulnerable.
The ongoing pandemic has worsen the situatoin. 

We have understood that people are having troubles with taking online deliveries to their door steps securely.
Since people in Sri Lanka are so busy today, they canâ€™t pay much attention about their loved once and the household.
So, we thought we can come up with a system of interconnected devices (inspired from IoT) to make the life easy for the people.

Our goal is to provide a user-friendly and completely automated solution for the above problems, which will be a success even after the end of the pandemic.

  2.Inside user(home owner) gets a notification to his/her phone , informing that there is a delivery person is at the gate.
  3.Inside user can access the camera module in the control unit and get a photo of the delivery person and see if that is an actual delivery person.
  4.Inside user can commiunicate with the delivery person using the intercom system which is integrated to the control unit.
  5.Inside user can unlock and open up the smart mail box.
  6.Delivery person can place the delivery package inside the smart mailbox.
